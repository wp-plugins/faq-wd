Do you need an elegant FAQ section to describe details of your services, terms and conditions? You have a long company history and want to have it in Q&A format? Then FAQ WD will be the most convenient tool for reaching a highly professional result. 

Using the FAQ WD plugin you can create unlimited amount of questions and assign them to categories. The accordion view will allow displaying only the questions thus saving space and allowing the user to navigate to the relevant question. To make the question search even user, it is possible to display a FAQ-specific search box.

The FAQ section sequence will be based on the Category order, which can be modified in Order section  using drag and drop functionality. Only the categories set within the shortcode will be displayed in the page/post allowing to use different categories for different pages within the site.

The categories can have descriptions. The details about the categories will be possible to insert with the FAQs. In case of multi-category FAQs the categories (if the titles are displayed)will turn into separate tabs. You can also skip displaying category details and titles, thus the questions will be listed below each other based on the category order provided in Order section.
